These noodles are made with chicken, but if you are craving beef try making Beef Yakisoba instead. Also, feel free to omit the chicken or beef if you are a vegetarian! The noodles are just as delicious meatless or tossed with some grilled tofu instead.  What is Yakisoba? Yakisoba noodles look similar to ramen noodles, but they are slightly different. They are made of wheat and best when stir-fried. A traditional yakisoba dish is made with thin slices of pork, carrots, cabbage, onions and a signature sweet and salty sauce. We love our yakisoba with chicken, but feel free to substitute pork if you so wish!  Ingredients for Yakisoba Noodles  Red Bell Pepper – you can also use green or yellow bell peppers. Carrot – add some color by adding mixed colored carrots. Green Onions – if you don’t have any on hand, you can skip out on it. Boneless Chicken – beef, pork, shrimp, tofu or more veggies are also great options. Cabbage Head – green cabbage is the best in this recipe. Yellow Onion – you can also use white onions. Yakisoba Noodles – ramen noodles, sold in most grocery stores fridge section.    Yakisoba Sauce Ingredients:   Sugar – white sugar will give you the best flavors in this dish. Soy Sauce – low sodium soy sauce will make the best option. Oyster Sauce – that deep flavor, such a great addition to the sauce. Ketchup – this will add a tart and sweet taste to the dish. Worcester Sauce – is a must for the recipe, it gives it a really great deep flavor.  How to Make Yakisoba  Combine all your sauce ingredients together Prep your veggies and cook your noodles.Note: some varieties come precooked and only need a quick reheating.  Cook all your veggies in a skillet until golden brown. Cook your chicken in a separate pan. Add your veggies back into your chicken pan. Add in the sauce and stir to combine.  Add your noodles into the mixture. Cook for a few minutes. Serve!           Where to Buy Yakisoba Noodles Yakisoba noodles are becoming so popular that you can find them in most grocery stores.

As a heads up, yakisoba noodles are sold a couple of different ways. Sometimes they are stored in packages with water and only need to be drained and tossed in the pan. Other times, yakisoba noodles are vacuum-sealed and need to be revived by placing them in cold water to loosen them up before cooking.  Tips for the Best Yakisoba  Prepare all your ingredients ahead of time for easier stir-frying.  Use a wok pan to prepare your noodles if you have one. If you don’t, use a large skillet.  Slice your chicken into thin strips for quicker cooking.  Don’t overcook your yakisoba. This dish has a tendency to dry out if stir-fried too long.   Other Asian Noodle Recipes  Asian noodle dishes are always LOVED in our home. Try your hand at making a couple other of our favorites:   Beef Lo Mein – Most people LOVE chow mein, but have you tried it’s close cousin lo mein?

Truth be told, good cooking is more about mastering techniques than following recipes, and the best dishes are often the simplest to make. A perfectly cooked steak is a prime example. With just a handful of ingredients and a single pan, you can prepare a steak that rivals anything you’d enjoy at a high-end steakhouse.\\nThe secret is mastering the art of pan-searing. This classic technique involves cooking the surface of your food undisturbed in a piping hot pan until a crisp, golden-brown, and flavorful crust forms. It’s the key to building flavor and texture in a dish while preventing sticking and giving your meal a restaurant-quality appearance. Pan-searing is hands-down the best way to cook a steak\\xa0 (it works wonders for salmon and scallops, too), and it also happens to be incredibly easy.\\n\\nWhat you’ll need to Cook Steak on The Stovetop\\n\\nWhen it comes to beef, the best candidates for pan-searing are boneless, quick-cooking cuts between one and one-and-a-half inches thick, such as NY Strip, rib eye or filet mignon. (For larger or slow-cooking cuts, like beef tenderloin with red wine sauce or beef stew with carrots and potatoes, pan-searing is usually the first step, and then you finish the cooking in the oven.)\\nHow to cook steak On The Stovetop\\nTo begin, pat the steak dry with paper towels. (Any moisture on the exterior of the steak must first evaporate before the meat begins to brown.)\\nSeason the steaks generously on both sides with salt and pepper; the seasoning will stick to the surface and help create a delicious crust.'),\n",

The best pans for pan-searing are stainless steel or cast-iron since they can withstand high temperatures.\\nAdd the oil to the pan. You’ll know it’s hot enough when it begins to shimmer and move fluidly around the pan.\\nCarefully set the steak in the pan, releasing it away from you so the oil doesn’t splatter in your direction. It should sizzle. (Use a pan that is large enough that it’s not such a tight fit or the pan will cool down and your food will steam instead of sear.)\\n\\nLeave it alone! Avoid the temptation to peek or fiddle or flip repeatedly. The steaks need a few minutes undisturbed to develop a brown crust. (Don’t worry about sticking; the steaks will release easily when they are ready to flip.)\\nFlip the steaks when they release easily and the bottom is a deep-brown color (usually about 3 minutes).\\n\\nContinue to cook the steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes on the bottom side for rare or medium-rare.\\nDuring the last minute of cooking, add 1 tablespoon of butter and a few sprigs of fresh thyme to the pan with the steaks (this is optional but delicious).\\n\\nIf you are serving the steaks unsliced, transfer them to plates and serve hot. If you plan to slice the steaks, transfer them to a cutting board and let rest, covered with aluminum foil, for 5 to 10 minutes; then slice thinly against the grain.

Master this technique to whip up a steak that rivals your favorite steakhouse.\\n\\n\\nServings: 2 to 4\\nPrep Time: 4 Minutes\\nCook Time: 6 Minutes\\nTotal Time: 10 Minutes\\n\\n\\nIngredients\\n\\n2 (12-oz) New York strip or ribeye steaks or 4 (6-oz) filet mignons, about 1½ inches thick\\n1 heaping teaspoon kosher salt\\n½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil\\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter\\nA few sprigs fresh thyme leaves\\n\\n\\n\\nInstructions\\n\\nTo begin, pat the steaks dry with paper towels. \\nSeason the steaks all over with the salt and pepper.\\nTurn on your exhaust fan and heat a heavy pan (preferably cast iron or stainless steel) over medium-high heat until it's VERY hot. \\nAdd the oil to the pan and heat until it begins to shimmer and move fluidly around the pan.\\nCarefully set the steaks in the pan, releasing them away from you so the oil doesn’t splatter in your direction. The oil should sizzle. \\nLeave the steaks alone! Avoid the temptation to peek or fiddle or flip repeatedly; the steaks need a few minutes undisturbed to develop a golden crust. Flip the steaks when they release easily and the bottom is a deep-brown color, about 3 minutes.  Continue to cook the steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes on the second side for rare to medium-rare. (For medium, cook 4 to 5 minutes on second side; for well-done, cook 5 to 6 minutes on second side). \\nDuring the last minute of cooking, add the butter and thyme sprigs to the pan with the steaks.\\nIf you are serving the steaks unsliced, transfer them to plates and serve hot. If you plan to slice the steaks, transfer them to a cutting board and let rest, covered with aluminum foil, for 5 to 10 minutes; then slice thinly against the grain. \\n\\n\\n\\nPair with\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWedge Salad\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreamed Spinach\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCrispy Roasted Potatoes\"),\n",

I modified it just slightly and added some lemon-pepper rub with the salt and pepper and probably used more butter than originally called for. It browned VERY quickly for me after 3 mins at med-high so I did take the pan off and set it aside on another stove top, not in use, before flipping and finishing the other side off back on the stove. Towards the end I flipped it every so often until I felt it was good. IT WAS SOOO GOOOD!! Very tender, juicy, and had a perfect medium pink to the inside. I originally had 2 sirloins that I was going to eat one and save the other for the next day, but DADGUM, ended up easily polishing both off. Directions were easy enough and having pictures was very helpful. Thanks for the recipe share and making me more excited to cook!'),\n",

Your fried rice will turn out best if you use cold, long-grain rice (like jasmine rice). It's really important to properly cool the rice down so if you're in a rush and just cooked the rice, spread it thinly on a tray, cover loosely with some cling wrap and pop in the fridge until cool.\\nSoy sauce. We usually use whatever soy sauce is on hand, but of course you can use gluten-free soy sauce (tamari) or low-sodium soy sauce instead and still create a flavourful fried rice.\\nOil: A good neutral vegetable oil works best for frying, but you can add sesame for added flavour, if you like.\\nBacon: While we do think the bacon really helps the flavours in this dish, if you don't have it to hand, we have used ham as an alternative.\\nPeas: frozen peas that have been thawed beforehand works best.\\nCarrot: Adds colour and texture. We prefer grated or very finely julienned in this recipe.\\nEggs: We form an omelette with the eggs to mix through our fried rice, but you could always create a scrambled eggs texture, if you prefer.\\nShallots: Don't be tempted to skip these. They add colour, flavour and texture. If you've got a fussy eater in your household, you can dial them back a touch, but they really do help round out the flavours of the dish.\\nAdditions: Have some sesame oil and oyster sauce on hand? Brilliant! (We've listed vegetable oil here, but sesame oil brings extra flavour to your plate, as does a splash of oyster sauce or fish sauce). A great way to use up leftover veggies and protein, fried rice recipes can be bolstered with plenty of healthy ingredients and can easily be made vegetarian or vegan.\\n\\nYou could also jazz things up with kimchi to make a kimchi fried rice.\"),\n",

For the best results, it’s also ideal to use cooled or chilled rice, which is why I often make it the day before. Once it’s cooled, simply spread out onto a tray, cover with plastic film and refrigerate until required.” - Digital Food Director, Amira Georgy.\\nHow can I make a low FODMAP version of this fried rice?\\nMake this a Low FODMAP recipe by only using green tips of spring onion instead of shallots and reducing or omitting the peas.\\nIf I already have leftover cooked rice, how much will I need for this recipe?\\nAlready have leftover rice? Brilliant. You will need 3 cups of leftover white rice (cooked) for this fried rice recipe. While white rice generally carries the flavour of your sauces better than brown rice, you can use cooked brown rice or another pre-cooked chilled rice to make a fried rice.\\nCan you make fried rice in an air fryer?\\nYes, you can and it's great way to prepare fried rice it if you're trying to reduce the amount of oil in your cooking. For instructions, just follow our air fryer fried rice recipe.\\nIs fried rice healthy?\\nDue to the fact it's, well, fried and high in calories and fats, fried rice is certainly not the healthiest of dishes.

       "'Page: Fettuccine Alfredo\\nSummary: Fettuccine Alfredo (Italian: [fettut\\'tʃiːne alˈfreːdo]) is a pasta dish consisting of fettuccine tossed with butter and Parmesan cheese, which melt and emulsify to form a rich cheese sauce coating the pasta. Originating in Rome in the early 20th century, the recipe is now popular in the United States and other countries. Outside of Italy, cream is sometimes used to thicken the sauce, and ingredients such as chicken, shrimp, salmon or broccoli may also be added when it is served as a main course.\\nThe dish is named after Alfredo Di Lelio, a Roman restaurateur who is credited with its invention and popularisation. Di Lelio\\'s tableside service was an integral part of the recipe\\'s success. Fettuccine Alfredo is a variant of standard Italian fettuccine al burro (\\'fettuccine with butter\\') or pasta burro e parmigiano (\\'pasta with butter and Parmesan cheese\\'). It is a kind of pasta in bianco, that is, without added sauce. Italian recipes do not include cream and are not topped with other ingredients, nor is the dish generally called \"Alfredo\" in Italy'"
